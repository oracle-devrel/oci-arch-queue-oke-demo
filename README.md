## Introduction
This repository contains the code and instructions to create and run an OCI Queue demo that runs a consumer that can autoscale on Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE), a demo producer that you can run anywhere(Local Desktop/Virtual Machine), and an OCI Function that provides queue depth for the autoscaling of queue consumers with KEDA.

An overview video and demo video is available [here](https://youtu.be/4RMA_EMjyfo) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC3h9LmKgGY).

This document walks through the build and deployment necessary to configure the demo. Each part of the demo has a readme file explaining how to build and deploy the components in the demo. Which can be found at:

- <a href="https://github.com/oracle-devrel/terraform-oci-arch-queue" target="_blank">Terraforn Repo</a> that can be used to setup the complete solution in your tenancy. As Producer can be executed from your local laptop/ VM instance etc. so it can be done manually after capturing output parameters for Queue OCID and DP endpoint from Resource manager output.
- [Producer](./local-producer/readme.md)


## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

- Permission to `manage` the following types of resources in your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy: `vcns`, `internet-gateways`, `route-tables`, `network-security-groups`, `subnets`, `OKE`, `functions` , `api gateway` and `Queue`.
- Quota to create all of these services  


### Deployment

#### Deployment using Terraform
- <a href="https://github.com/oracle-devrel/terraform-oci-arch-queue">Terraforn Repo</a> that can be used to setup the complete solution in your tenancy. As Producer can be executed from your local laptop/ VM instance etc. so it can be done manually after capturing output parameters for Queue OCID and DP endpoint from Resource manager output.
- [Producer](./local-producer/readme.md)

#### Manual Deployment

You can deploy it manually in case if you have resources(e.g. OKE Cluster, Application, API gateway ) provisioned already. Please check invidual README files for manual deployment
- [Manual Deployment](./README_manual.md)

##### Execution

With the services deployed and configured along with our [Consumer](./oke-consumer/readme.md) and [Queue Depth function](./queue-length-function/readme.md). Execution is simply a case of running one of the scripts provided by the [Producer](./local-producer/readme.md).

#### Observing queue production and consumption

As observing how the different elements execute is unique to that element, the readme documentation for those elements describes how you can see them work. Please check the demo links [here](https://youtu.be/4RMA_EMjyfo) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC3h9LmKgGY) to get more detail.
