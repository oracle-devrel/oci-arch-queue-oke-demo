## Introduction

The following document describes how to create the Producer application in the demo. This application generates a pushes the content into the queue. It is designed to be run anywhere (local desktop or VM, for example).

## Getting Started

The folder includes two scripts (provided in Windows (.bat) and Linux bash (.sh) formats. As a recommended precaution, it is worth running the [dos2unix](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29030/dos2unix-1.html) and [unix2dos](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36784_01/html/E36870/unix2dos-1.html) scripts on these files just in case a version is pushed that hasn't been corrected.

- **getStats.[bat|sh]** - this script sets the environment variable to tell the application that the configuration file with the properties necessary is in the same directory as where you run the tool from.  It then uses Maven to create and execute the tool, which will then send to the console details of the test queue.
- **producer.[bat|sh]** - this script works in the same way as the getStats script by setting the environment variable and then using Maven to compile and execute the utility. The difference being this will then start generating and putting messages in the Queue.

As the Java utility needs to communicate with OCI, it requires the user details to authenticate the user, as mentioned in the overall [readme](../README.md) and explained in the [ SDK documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm). You may wish to use separate users for the producer and consumer.

### Prerequisites

- [Java JDK 8 or later](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [Oracle OCI SDK](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/javasdk.htm)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- User with the privileges to interact with the OCI Queue - we describe a simple solution to this in the parent [readme](../README.md).

Maven and Java are assumed to be visible using the PATH environment variable.

#### Making the queue identifiable and accessible

Within the code is a class called *Environment* (*src/main/java/com/demo/samples/basic/Environment.java*) which declares several constants that capture the OCI Queue OCID, the URL for the OCI Data Plane endpoint, and the attributes necessary for authenticating and authorization to use the service.

These values need to have their defaults replaced with the appropriate values established during the OCI Queue setup.

If the Queue is not configured in the Phoenix region, then the region part of the name(for the data plane URL) needs to be modified to reflect the region being used.

#### <u>Creating the JAR file</u>

Once you update *Enviornment.java* , then you have to build your project.
This is a maven-based project we can use standard maven commands like this:

`*mvn clean package*`
Once the command is executed successfully, it will create a jar file in *./target* folder.
Post successful execution of the above command, you can run *.bat/.sh* file to see producer/getStat in action.

### Dynamic Group and Policies


We are going to use instance principal (assuming we are running it on OCI instance), so we have to create a dynamic group, e.g., dynamic group name should be *queue_dg* . We can use the following commands (remember to replace the <values> with your own actual values):

`ALL {instance.compartment.id='<instance Compartment id>'}`
please use the following policy
`allow dynamic-group queue_dg to use queues in compartment <queue_parent_compartment>`


The above policies and dynamic group are needed when using instance principal(when you are hosting and running it from OCI virtual machine), if you are planning to run it locally(on a laptop/desktop), then you will have to generate API keys and ensure you have access to queue service using a grou ,e.g. 

`Allow group \<user group name\> to use queues in compartment \<compartment name of queue parent compartment\>`
